# Andrew's personal dotfiles

These are, predictably enough, my dotfiles. They're designed to give me an environment I personally feel comfortable with.

## Composition

### The `core` folder

The `core` folder holds any dotfiles that are common between OSes. I currently use Fedora, Arch Linux, and macOS, so I make
every effort to ensure the files in here are common to each OS (or at least would be harmless if applied to an OS that doesn't
understand what the file is).

This folder includes:

* A fontconfig `.fonts.conf` file.
* An overview of my current font setup.
* Application configurations.
* My zshrc.

### The `arch` folder

This is not yet committed, but this folder will contain the setup on my Arch laptop as of May 2021, and will be updated periodically.
I use the Sway Wayland compositor, as I was interested in working in a tiled window manager environment.

### The `fedora` folder

As of yet, there's none (aside from the `core` of course).

### The `macos` folder

As of yet, there's none (aside from the `core` of course).
