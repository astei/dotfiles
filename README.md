# Andrew's personal dotfiles

These are, predictably enough, my dotfiles. They're designed to give me an environment I personally feel comfortable with.

This is structured in such a matter that the files can just be symlinked into the `.config` folder and I'm on my way. Note however that this isn't exactly a "drag-and-drop" operation, or more precisely a "symlink and go" operation - there is quite some work involved in replicating my configuration completely...
